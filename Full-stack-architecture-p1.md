# Full Stack Architecture Design Best Practices

Here are 20 best practices for full stack architecture design:

1. **Adopt a Layered Architecture** - Separate your application into distinct layers (presentation, business logic, data access) to improve maintainability and allow independent evolution of each layer.

2. **Use Microservices When Appropriate** - Break complex applications into smaller, independent services that communicate via APIs for better scalability and team autonomy.

3. **Implement API Gateways** - Create a single entry point for all client requests to simplify client-side code and provide cross-cutting concerns like authentication and rate limiting.

4. **Design for Statelessness** - Build stateless services where possible to improve scalability and resilience, storing state in databases or distributed caches.

5. **Apply Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** - Model your software based on the underlying business domain to create more intuitive and maintainable systems.

6. **Adopt Containerization** - Use Docker or similar tools to package applications and their dependencies for consistent deployment across environments.

7. **Implement CI/CD Pipelines** - Automate testing and deployment to increase release frequency and reliability.

8. **Design with Observability in Mind** - Include comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing to understand system behavior and troubleshoot issues.

9. **Apply the Strangler Pattern for Legacy Systems** - Gradually replace legacy systems by intercepting calls to the old system and routing them to new components.

10. **Implement Proper Authentication and Authorization** - Use modern auth protocols like OAuth 2.0 and JWT, and apply the principle of least privilege.

11. **Adopt Event-Driven Architecture** - Use events to communicate between services for better decoupling and scalability in complex systems.

12. **Design for Failure** - Implement circuit breakers, retries, and fallbacks to create resilient systems that can handle partial failures.

13. **Use Caching Strategically** - Apply caching at multiple levels (browser, CDN, API, database) to improve performance.

14. **Consider Server-Side Rendering vs. Client-Side Rendering** - Choose the appropriate rendering strategy based on SEO needs, performance requirements, and application complexity.

15. **Implement Feature Flags** - Use feature toggles to control feature rollout and enable safe experimentation in production.

16. **Adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** - Define infrastructure through code to ensure consistency and enable version control of environment configurations.

17. **Design for Horizontal Scalability** - Build systems that can scale out by adding more instances rather than scaling up by adding resources to existing instances.

18. **Implement Database Sharding** - Partition large databases to improve performance and manageability for data-intensive applications.

19. **Apply the CQRS Pattern When Needed** - Separate read and write operations for complex domains with different performance and scaling requirements.

20. **Design with Security at All Levels** - Implement security controls throughout the stack (network, infrastructure, application, data) rather than treating it as an afterthought.
